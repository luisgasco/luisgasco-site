abstract: "We present the Multilingual Entity Linking of Occupations (MELO) Benchmark, a new collection of 48 datasets for evaluating the linking of entity mentions in 21 languages to the ESCO Occupations multilingual taxonomy. MELO was built using high-quality, pre-existent human annotations. We conduct experiments with simple lexical models and general-purpose sentence encoders, evaluated as bi-encoders in a zero-shot setup, to establish baselines for future research. The datasets and source code for standardized evaluation are publicly available at https://github.com/Avature/melo-benchmark."
