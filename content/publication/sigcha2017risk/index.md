abstract: 'Workplace noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss are closely related to worker’s attitudes about the use of hearing protection devices. Previous studies have shown that workers are unwilling to use them for different reasons: The lack of knowledge of the noise effects in hearing health, difficulties to use them correctly, discomfort, etc. With the aim of improving the workers’ attitudes towards the use of hearing protection devices, a bibliographic study was made about the factors that influence the worker’s behavior about the use of hearing protectors, as well as their knowledge of the associated risks. After analyzing the background and current needs, a user-friendly interactive tools were developed to raise workers’ awareness of this issue. It is presented a review of the literature on the use of hearing protectors, an analysis of the different approaches commonly used for training and awareness of workers on the risks of noise-induced hearing loss, and finally the tools developed as a proposal to improve the hearing loss risk perception among workers.'
