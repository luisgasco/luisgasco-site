title: "The Future of Recruiting: Human with an AI Touch"

event: Irish Centre for Business Excellence (ICBE) Conference 2025
event_url: https://icbe2025.com/

location: Kilkenny, Ireland

abstract: 'I had the privilege of speaking at the ICBE2025 conference, hosted by the Irish Centre for Business Excellence. The event focused on the transformative role of artificial intelligence in shaping talent, leadership, and business processes.

As part of the program, I contributed alongside the presentation of the AI4Labour project findings, which explore how AI is reshaping the future of work and redefining the skills organizations will need. Building on that, I offered a complementary perspective: in today’s competitive global environment, it’s not only about learning new skills, but also identifying them effectively in the labour market.

With that in mind, I showcased some of the work we’re doing at Avature to enhance talent discovery through cutting-edge technologies in skills intelligence and generative AI, while staying true to the human side of HR by empowering recruiters and building tools that are fair, transparent, and explainable.'
