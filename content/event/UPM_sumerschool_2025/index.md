location: Madrid, Spain

abstract: 'My talk was a new  chance to reflect on how the mindset and rigor developed in academic research can bring significant value when designing AI systems for real-world impact.

During the talk, I shared examples of the value we’re bringing to the HR space, along with some of our latest work in hashtag#AI, including:
 • The integration of Generative AI into our platform through our own 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗹𝗼𝘁, built to support recruiters in doing their job.
 • Major improvements to our 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺, fully developed in-house using neural models.
 • The expansion of our 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝘁𝗮𝘅𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆 from ~6,000 to ~25,000 entries, thanks to semantic technologies, with much more growth expected in the coming months.'
