[Noytext](https://www.noytext.com/) is an open source application whose main objective is to facilitate the annotation of short texts. The application, developed using the R-shiny framework, tries to reduce the entry barrier in the application of NLP technologies in Acoustic Engineering. It allows a quick and easy installation, as well as high customization capabilities.

Noytext is customizable and cross-platform.
