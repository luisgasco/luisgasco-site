Deepspanorm contains classes for training biencoder and crossencoder architectures that can be used for linking entities to controlled terminologies such as Snomed-CT, HPO, ICD or UMLS. The library provides a simple interface to generate triples for training models through constractive learning techniques, as well as functions for putting them into production and evaluating the models.

The repository is currently private. It will be published in conjunction with a scientific publication soon.
